/**
 * Represents one playing card from a standard 52-card deck
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card)
 *
 * Class Invariant:
 * - Card value represents the number/letter printed on the card,
 * usually in the corners (A, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, J, Q, K)
 * - Card value is stored as an integer to make error checking/validation easier,
 * but must be outputted appropriately (1 is A, 11 is J, 12 is Q, 13 is K) for user
 * - Card suit represents one of 4 suits (heart, diamond, club, spade)
 * - Card suit is stored as the unicode char representing the suit,
 * constant variables will be used throughout code for consistency
 * - Whenever value/suit is changed, it must be within the valid values
